# Invert Selection (Toggle Selection) Checkboxes & Radio Buttons (HTML forms)

Uses jQuery & JavaScript to select the opposite of any checkboxes that are currently selected

###Tutorial Sources
I cobbled together my own `invert()` function based on various sources. All of which I found to not meet my standards or were too complex

- **[JQuery checkboxes inverse selection | Marko Jakic](http://markojakic.net/jquery-checkboxes-inverse-selection) Probably the most help, but added to it & expanded compact if-else form**
- [jQuery Checkboxes: Select All, Select None, and Invert Selection](https://www.abeautifulsite.net/jquery-checkboxes-select-all-select-none-and-invert-selection) A start, but not much help
- **[Stack Overflow: ](http://stackoverflow.com/a/1318088) finally figured out why adding `checked` wasn't actually updating the html**
- [CSS-Tricks: A jQuery hasAttr() Equivalent](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/jquery/make-an-jquery-hasattr/) testing if an an element has an attribute
- [Stack Overflow: jQuery checkbox event handling](http://stackoverflow.com/a/29367737) helped when finding how to call functions
